# Git Gud
Git should have this command auto included in his file.

Everybody need an easy way to push on the master branch.

To make the program work simply add the aliase from gitconfig to your gitconfig file or run the following

``` git config alias.gud "\!git add -A && git commit --allow-empty -m \"Git Gud\" && git push origin master -f && echo \"Git Gud Scrub\"" ```
# PS: Don't take this command seriously
